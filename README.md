# Calendar

I created this calendar as a daily planner for me to track the weather, meetings and a to-do list of items I want to complete for the day. 
On this website, you will see the following features:
    *A weather display that shows the daily weather forecast for my area (Covington, KY). This information pulls from a Weather API. 
    *The current date and time displays in the header 
    *There is a countdown timer for my upcoming vacation (8/13/22) 
    * The 9:00 meeting for Sara is displayed in teal because this meeting needs to be moved. You can drag and drop this to 7:00, 8:00, 10:00 or 5:00. 
    *The use of an Array that will display when you click on any of the "contact info" buttons on the calendar. The name, phone number and email should appear. 
    *The to-do list will strike-through items once they have been completed. You can also remove items from the checklist or add new items. 
    
    The layout is responsive and will change from XL desktop to desktop (around 1320) and a mobile/tablet view (around 768).
